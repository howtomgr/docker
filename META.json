  "description": "Docker is a free and open-source containerization platform that enables developers to package applications and their dependencies into portable containers. Originally developed by Solomon Hykes at dotCloud, Docker revolutionized application deployment by providing OS-level virtualization. It serves as a FOSS alternative to proprietary virtualization solutions like VMware vSphere, Microsoft Hyper-V containers, or commercial container platforms, offering comparable functionality with features like image layering, container orchestration, and resource isolation.",
